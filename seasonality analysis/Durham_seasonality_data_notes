Notes on Analysis:

Durham County, NC does not appear to be reporting Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander case data consistently, so this category, along with the 2+ race category for which no data was reported, was removed from the data set prior to analysis.

For the November data, it appears the race & ethnicity data was only reported for 20 out of 30 days. The days for which data was not reported were around Thanksgiving. Data was not reported for 11/20 through 11/22 and 11/24 through 11/29. Data was reported on 11/23 the Monday prior to Thanksgiving.
