Data for total cummulative cases for a county were taken from the confirmed case totals provided in the Broadstreet Daily Numbers dataset for Cobb County, GA.

The total number of cases recorded based on race and/or ethnicity do not add up to the cummulative total for confirmed cases on the corresponding date (even when including the not specified/unknown categories).

In the data used, the average % of cases which did not report an ethnicity (or the ethnicity was included in the unknown category):
  Summer: 0.5203167
  Fall:  0.3344875
  Winter: 0.2772638
  
In the data used, the average % of cases which did not report a race (or the race was included in the other/unknown category):
  Summer: 0.5775404
  Fall:  0.3780287
  Winter: 0.3226512

In the data, case counts for American Indian/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Other race & Unknown race were combined into a single category titled 'other_race' to account for inconsistencies in reporting other vs. unknown race specifically from June through October.

Dates that were missing data and were therefore not reported in the data include:
  2020-06-25
  2020-07-01
  2020-07-04

In the case rates categories:

Case rate was defined as the cumulative number of cases in the racial/ethnic category, divided by the total number of individuals of that race/ethnicity in Cobb County as reported by the 2019 American Community Survey (ACS).

Daily case rate was defined as the daily change in cumulative number of cases from the previous day in that racial/ethnic category, divided by the total number of individuals of that race/ethnicity in Cobb County as reported by the 2019 American Community Survey (ACS).



A second dataset was explored with several dates in December dropped from analysis due extreme differences in case numbers reported (i.e. adding an abnormally large number of cases on one day or subtracting a large nummber of cases).
Dates removed from this dataset included those removed from the main dataset plus:
  2020-12-03
  2020-12-04
  2020-12-08
  2020-12-20
  2020-12-21
  2020-12-27
  
  Removed: 2020-12-29, 2020-12-17, 2020-12-07 post daily rates calc since these appear to be data dump dates
  Removed 2020-06-15 as well since this was the first date in the dataset (unable to calculate daily rates for this
  date)
